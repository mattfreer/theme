A <code>.grid-row</code> component applies layout rules to direct descendants. Descendants are rendered in a row, with each element having an equal size within the container. Multiple <code>.grid-row</code> components can be used together to produce a table-like layout.  A <code>.stretch</code> class can be applied to any child of a <code>grid-row</code>, with the effect of expanding the width of the child to take up 3 times the amount of space as other children. This is commonly applied to the first-child of a row.
